To-Do
Me:
1.Need to check why jquery script runs slow on the very first return of a string
2. Make it so script displays only Finishing at the end instead of starting rotation again.

Help From Trevor:
1. Make Gallery Display all submitted names.
2. GIF is rotating it doesn't start over every time you submit a new name
